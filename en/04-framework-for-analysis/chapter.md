# Framework for Analysis

The following is a more sensible approach to determining whether or not it is a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea. It is not a universal test for eligibility. There are other issues besides abstractness implicating eligibility that may arise, such as whether the patentee has claimed a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter.^[*See AllVoice Developments v. Microsoft*, \__ F.3d \__ (Fed. Cir. 2015) (acknowledging that, "[e]xcept for process claims, the eligible subject matter must exist in some physical or tangible form.") (internal quotations ommitted). "To be considered a machine under section 101, 'the claimed invention must be a concrete thing, consisting of parts, or of certain devices and combination of devices." *Id.* (internal quotations ommitted).]

## Test: Does the patentee claim an information system?

The Supreme Court test in *Mayo* first asks, "Is the claim directed to an abstract idea?" In every case, lawyers and judges struggle to answer that question. A more digestible question in many could be: "is the claim directed to an information system?"

If so, it is directed to an abstract idea. The claimed invention takes data in, processes it, and produces information. No matter how complex the claim is, it is directed to an abstract idea. It may include subsystems or communication between systems. But at the end, it reduces to a "building block of human ingenuity."

Federal Circuit recognized this in *Digitech Image Technologies, LLC v. Electronics For Imaging, Inc.*, where it stated:

> *Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible*. If a claim is directed essentially to a method of calculating, using a mathematical formula, even if the solution is for a specific purpose, the claimed method is nonstatutory.^[758 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting *Parker v. Flook*, 437 U.S. 584, 595 (1978)) (emphasis added and internal quotations omitted).]

An ineligible claim may be directed at the information system itself, or an article (such as computer media) performing its functions. Or it may describe the flow of information as a process or method. In all cases, it is directed to the processing of information.

*  Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2359 ("use of a computer to create electronic records, track multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous instructions" is not an inventive concept)

* INTELLECTUAL VENTURES I LLC v. CAPITAL ONE BANK (USA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

* Indeed, the steps of consulting and updating an activity log represent insignificant "data-gathering steps," CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc., 654 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2011)

* Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, National Ass'n, 776 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2014),

Note that the question is not "*is* the claim an abstract idea." It asks whether the claim is *directed to* an abstract idea. There may be concrete, tangible limitations involved, such as computer devices or components. Or there may be transformations of some sort, such as manipulating hardware registers or growing microbial cultures. The reader must take a 50-foot view of the claimed invention, in light of problem the inventor is trying to solve.

But answering this question in the affirmative is not the final word on ineligibility. It is only a *clue* that the invention, as claimed, is merely an idea in the abstract.

## Exception 1: Is the patentee applying the information system to create a "new and useful" machine or transformation of a "thing"?

This is the first off ramp for a potentially eligible information system. And although it sounds like the familiar  "machine-or-transformation test," it is not.^[The Federal Circuit held at one time that a claim was an eligible process if it only if: "(1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing." 545 F. 3d \__, 954. The Supreme Court rejected the test as the sole test for eligibility in *Bilski v Kappos*, \__ U.S. \__ (2009).]

* Parker and Diehr.

* "an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection." Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 187, 101 S.Ct. 1048, 67 L.Ed.2d 155 (1981).

* Research Corp. Techs., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. "Indeed, this court notes that inventions with specific applications or improvements to technologies in the marketplace are not likely to be so abstract that they override the statutory language and framework of the Patent Act."

## Exception 2: Is the patentee claiming a "new and useful" technological solution for a problem rooted in a technological environment?

* SiRF and DDR

* Contra Ultramercial: the claims simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea with routine, conventional activity.

* Contra OIP TECHNOLOGIES, INC. v. Amazon. com, Inc.

## Exception 3: Has the patentee claimed an embodiment proportionate to the inventor's advancement of the technological arts?

* Morse v Oreilly and Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard

* Ariosa v. Sequenom. "It is important to note that the '540 patent does not merely claim uses or applications of cffDNA, it claims methods for detecting the natural phenomenon. Because generally one must be able to find a natural phenomenon to use it and apply it, claims covering the only commercially viable way of detecting that phenomenon do carry a substantial risk of preempting all practical uses of it." The invention IS the way of detecting.
