## A Synthesis of the Court's Response to Information Systems

The Court's recent jurisprudence has reasoned by reference to "abstract ideas," "laws of nature," or "fundamental principles." These phrases are not helpful because when evaluating inventions involving information systems because they too are amorphous concepts. Information systems, such as general purpose computers, are often not themselves abstract--they are in fact often typically tangible embodiments such as a specially-written software program running on specifically-procured computers. And all inventions, even the most physical, can be reduced to an abstract notion or idea, even if that notion is something like "improve reliability by minimizing the number of moving parts" or "use electro-magnetism to transmit characters over a distance."

The balance the Court has sought has been to permit monopolization of only specific *applications* of ideas to a new and useful end, whether the idea was new or not. In the *Telegraph Case* the Court permitted several apparatuses claimed for an electromagnet telegraph, but not the idea of an electromagnet telegraph itself regardless of form, even if no one had before used electromagnetics to print characters at a distance.  In the *Rubber-Tip Pencil* case, the Court suggested a specific claim for a combination of a pencil and rubber tip may be eligible (although it may fail for novelty or obviousness), but the patentee could not claim using any rubber, regardless of form, with the idea of attaching to it a pencil.

Once computers emerged, the Court immediately recognized that the use of general-purpose computers added nothing to attempts to claim basic principles. Benson could not claim a mathematic formula even if he had limited its use to computers. A simpler way to understand the problem in Benson is to view it as a claim for a *naked information system*. Benson's claim, described as claim for an algorithm, was for an information system because it accepted data (a number in BCD-form) and processed the data to more useful information in binary form. Because it was nothing more than an information system, it was nothing more than the mathematic principle itself, could be performed by humans, and provided no further advancement than the mathematics itself. Benson, according to Justice _____, claimed the bare idea of converting numbers from one form to another, regardless of how it was implemented.^[As discussed above in Section _____, only Claim 13 was a bare idea had no need for a specific implementation. Justice ____ apparently ignored that Claim 8, like Samuel Morse's claims one through seven, was for a specific implementation of performing the math on a specific apparatus.]

The decision in *Parker v. Flook* follows directly from this analysis. Parker claimed an information system that accepted input data (such as the current alarm base, predetermined alarm offset, and present value of a process variable) and processed the data using a mathematic formula to create information in the form of an updated alarm limit. The problem was that the claim was for nothing further than the information system. Just as in *Morse*, the claim reduced to the bare idea of using a principle (here, the mathematical formula rather than electromagnetics) for a desired purpose (catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons instead of printing characters at a distance). Just as in *Benson*, Parker did not advance the useful arts because he did not claim any new and useful end for the information created from his claimed method.

In *Diehr*, the Court recognized that the claim was for something more than an information system, even though it it was an information system.  It was the application of the system to achieve a useful, tangible result. The inventions accepted data inputs (including various constants, elapsed time of the press, and the temperature of the mold) and processed the data to create useful information (by using the Arrhenius equation to determine the total required cure time). The claim took one step further that made it a specific application of this information system for a useful end: "opening the press automatically" based on the output of the information system. Whether this application was novel or non-obvious was a different question.[^CITE] It met the threshold of eligibility because it was not merely a computer-based information system transforming data into information.

In *Bilski*, the Court addressed the issue more generally by looking an information system that did not involve computers, but involved instead people and organizations. The claim involved initiating "transactions," such as purchases. These transactions are mere data or information: knowledge that a consumer agrees to purchase a commodity from a provider at a particular rate. Thus, the claim, viewed as an information system, takes data as input (prior purchases and market participants for the commodity having a counter-risk position) and processes the data to generate new information (other transactions that would balance the provider's risk position).

The claims in *Mayo* were also directed at non-computer information systems. In fact, the claim very closely tracks our example of a doctor diagnosing a patient in Section ____. In the claimed method a doctor--or anyone or thing, really--accepted input data (determining the level of 6-thioguanine introduced by a drug) and producing information from the data (whether to increase or decrease the drug dose based on whether the level is above or below a specific range). The claim did not address a specific implementation for this system, such as a new way to administer the drug or determine its concentration in blood, and thus claimed no more than the basic natural principle of the ideal dosing for the drug. Nor did it apply the information about the drug levels to a new, useful end. Its steps stopped at the generating of information, and thus achieved nothing more than the updated alarm limits in *Flook*.

Finally, *Alice* addressed a computer-based information system creating and generating information from data. It was more complex than previous, inserting a third party that helped the system exchange information (credits or debits) created by processing data such as start-of-day and end-of-day balances of participating financial institutions. The involvement of a computer was only nominal.

It can be seen that each of these cases since *Benson* involve an information system or process performed by such a system, whether computer-implemented or achieved by people alone. With this understanding we can create a more specific framework than the two-step process in *Mayo* that
