## Patentable Subject Matter: "New and Useful" But Not "Laws of Nature, Physical Phenomena, and Abstract Ideas"

The overarching purpose of the Patent Act is to encourage innovation by leveraging the economic framework of a awarding limited monopoly to inventors. The founding fathers wrote this framework into the Constitution by granting Congress the power "[t]o promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors of the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."[^con] This clause incorporates a balancing act: granting exclusivity to creators (an intrinsically harmful social act) so long as it advances innovation in the "useful arts." The first Patent Act attempted to enact this balance by limiting patentable subject matter to "any useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or any improvement therein not before known or used."[^pa1970] When the framers used the term "useful arts," they meant what we in modern times call "technology."[^bilski1001] One can contrast "useful arts" with the concepts of 'liberal arts' and the 'fine arts.'[^sfekas]

Early jurisprudence, carried over from English cases, acknowledged that "principles" are not patentable. In the 1852 case *Le Roy v Tatham*, the Supreme Court stated: "[A] principle is not patentable. A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right."[^LeRoy174] The Court acknowledged that "[t]he word principle is used by elementary writers on patent subjects, and sometimes in adjudications of courts, with such a want of precision in its application, as to mislead."[^LeRoy174] Perhaps a better explanation is one by Justice Story, who explained that "[a] principle means an elementary truth, or power."[^barrett] In a machine that performs its functions by motion, for example, the motion in question is a principle, and the specific machinery employed is an application of the principle.[^barrett]

Justice Story's example of motion as a principle proved prescient, as years later, in 1853, the Supreme Court addressed addressed that very issue in *O'Reilly v. Morse*, also known as The Telegraph Patent Case.[^5] In 1840, Samuel Morse had obtained two patents for his invention of electro-magnetic telegraphs, which were reissued in 1848. Several claims were for specific machinery employed to use of electro-magnetism to send writing over a distance.[^6] The Court gave pause, however, when it reached is eighth claim. His patent, however, was not limited to the telegraph machine he had created; in his words:

> Eighth. I do not propose to limit myself to the specific machinery or parts of machinery described in the foregoing specification and claims; the essence of my invention being the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current, which I call electro-magnetism, however developed for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at any distances, being a new application of that power of which I claim to be the first inventor or discoverer

The Court recognized that in this claim Morse was trying to claim a principle--the *bare idea* of using of a kind of motion, rather than the specific apparatus employing that kind of motion. The claim would have allowed Morse to exclude others from using any methods of writing using electro-magnetism-including those Morse had -not described and indeed had not invented, and therefore could not describe when he obtained his patent.-[^7]

The Court in *Oreilly v. Morse* contrasted its claim 8 with a 19th-century English case, *Neilson v. Hartford*, 151 ER 1266 (1841). In that case, the patentee had discovered that heated air could be pumped into a furnace to improve the process of converting high-carbon iron to lower-carbon iron or steel and obtained a patent on the use of a heated chamber to provide the heated air.[^1] The defendants argued that the patent covered merely the abstract principle--a fundamental truth--that injecting hot air instead of cold air into a furnace created better iron.[^2] The Exchequer Court disagreed, holding that because even assuming this principle were well-known cannot be patented, the patentee had created a mechanical mode of applying the principle to furnaces.  The invention interposed a receptacle between a blowing apparatus and a furnace, and in the receptacle allowed the application of external heat to warm the air before it was introduced into the furnace.[^3] Thus, the patent was allowed because it claimed a specific manner for applying a principle, not the principle itself.

In 1874, the Supreme Court once again addressed patent-eligibility in *Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard.*[^9] In that case, the Court acknowledged that the patent was for a particular manufacture: a rubber eraser head that could be used to attach to a lead pencil. Thus, it faced a scenario more akin to that in *Neilson* rather than *Morse*. Yet the Court found the patent ineligible because it concluded it claimed no more than a bare idea, even though it claimed a useful thing! First, the Court pointed out that the patent was not for the combination of the rubber head with the pencil. This patent was for the rubber head by itself, and that was a different matter. The Court then examined the claim to identify what the patentee identified as the inventive aspects. The Court described the invention as being rubber with a hole, without the need for a particular shape of the head, and without any particular form and shape of the hole. None of these pointed to an invention because it meant that "[a]ny piece of rubber with a hole in it is all that is required thus far to meet the calls of the specifications." The last aspect put forth in the patent, that the cavity must be slightly smaller in diameter than whatever pencil into which it is to be used, "add[ed] nothing to the "patentable character of the invention."[^10] That part was conventional, because "[e]verybody knew, when the patent was applied for, that if a solid substance was inserted into a cavity in a piece of rubber smaller than itself, the rubber would cling to it."[^11] The patent amounted to nothing more than claiming a piece of rubber with a hole, along with "not new" ideas that: rubber will attach to anything larger than the hole into which that thing is inserted, and rubber is good for erasing.

These cases demonstrate that the inquiry is one of whether the claim seeks to patent a bare idea itself, rather than a specific application of that idea. Subsequent cases expand upon how to describe what are bare ideas: they are "scientific truth[s], or the mathematical expression of it,"[^mackay] "forces of nature,"[^telephone] "natural phenomena,"[^diehr] and, unhelpfully, "abstract ideas."

[^mackay]: Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 US 86 (1939).

[^telephone]: The Telephone Cases, 126 US 1 (1888).

[^diehr]: Diamond v. Diehr, 450 US 175, 185 (1981).

In *The Telephone Cases*, in 1888, the Court tried once again to explain how to tell the difference between discovery of a principle in the abstract, and a patentable invention:

> In this art--or, what is the same thing under the patent law, this process, this way of transmitting speech--electricity, one of the forces of nature, is employed; *but electricity, left to itself, will not do what is wanted. The art consists in so controlling the force as to make it accomplish the purpose.* It had long been believed that if the vibrations of air caused by the voice in speaking could be reproduced at a distance by means of electricity, the speech itself would be reproduced and understood. *How to do it was the question.*

> Bell discovered that it could be done by gradually changing the intensity of a continuous electric current, so as to make it correspond exactly to the changes in the density of the air caused by the sound of the voice. *This was his art. He then devised a way in which these changes of intensity could be made and speech actually transmitted.* Thus his art was put in a condition for practical use.[^telephone]

The complexity of this analysis, unfortunately, appeared to rise exponentially when innovations involving to general purpose computers began to arrive at the patent office, and for decades the Court struggled with a framework for evaluating the eligibility of computer-related patents.
