## The Return to Section 101

In 2010, the Supreme Court returned to the issue of patent-eligibility in *Bilski v. Kappos*, while considering a patent that purportedly covered hedging of risk.[^27] The Court decided to address the issue of whether the Machine-or-Transformation test should be used in analyzing whether a method patent covered eligible subject matter.[^28] The Machine-or-Transformation test articulated a simple, bright-line rule: a method is not patent-eligible unless it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus (machine), or transforms an article into a different state or thing (transformation).[^29] The Federal Circuit had held that this test was the *sole* test for patent-eligibility.[^30] Though the Supreme Court ultimately agreed that the patent was ineligible, it disagreed with the Federal Circuit's reasoning.[^31] In a widely anticipated opinion among practitioners, the Supreme Court emphatically declared that the Machine-or-Transformation test was a -useful and important clue [and] an investigative tool- for determining the eligibility of a claimed method, but it was not the sole test.[^32] The Supreme Court also made clear that Section 101 did not eliminate all business method patents either.[^33]

Ultimately, the Supreme Court found the patent in *Bislki* invalid for claiming an abstract idea without adding anything more to the underlying abstract principle.[^34] Only a cursory examination of the patent took place, however. The Supreme Court also did not articulate a framework to take the place of the Machine-or-Transformation test.[^35] It would take two more cases to begin structuring a replacement framework.

In *Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,*[^36] the asserted patents involved the -use of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.-[^37] The inventors of the asserted patents had discovered parameters which could be used to determine the range of effective dosages of thiopurine drugs for an individual patient and had patented a method based on these parameters.[^38] When analyzing the patent claims, the Supreme Court recited a two-step analysis. The first step required determining whether a patent preempted the use of a natural law.[^39] SCOTUS found that the patent set forth -relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood- and the effectiveness of a dosage-effectively, a law of nature.[^40] The second step required the court to determine whether there existed some inventive concept that could transform the patent and make it cover eligible subject matter.[^41] The Supreme Court found that the three additional steps in the patent claims did not:

> To put the matter more succinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about certain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well-understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community; and those steps, when viewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum of their parts taken separately.[^42]

The asserted patents, therefore, were ineligible for patent protection.[^43] In particular, as in *O'Reilly v. Morse*, the Supreme Court worried about preemption: the possibility of the asserted patents covering all ability of -doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients.-[^44]. Yeta a question still remained as to whether and how this framework applied to method patents beyond the realm of biological sciences.

In *Alice Corp. PTY v. CLS Bank Int-l*, the Supreme Court answered that question and adopted the *Mayo* two-step framework as the framework for analyzing patent eligibility of method patents--regardless of the technological field.[^45] The *Alice* patent involved a method of -exchanging financial obligations between two parties using a third-party intermediary to mitigate settlement risk.-[^46] The Supreme Court applied the *Mayo* framework and affirmed that the patent was invalid for covering patent-ineligible subject matter.[^47] As the first step of the *Mayo* analysis, the Supreme Court held that the patent itself covered the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, a concept which was a -fundamental economic practice long prevalent in [] system[s] of commerce.-[^48] At the second step, the Supreme Court analyzed whether the additional steps of the method, including the use of a computer to maintain -shadow records- to reconcile those transactions for which a party has sufficient resources, amounted to an -inventive concept- that would transform the patent beyond the abstract idea; they did not.[^49] Again, one of the major concerns of the Supreme Court was the issue of preemption.[^50] Here, the Supreme Court emphasized that a general purpose computer, by itself or performing conventional steps, failed to make an ineligible patent eligible.[^51]
